Energy
Basic energy units
key0=Mod operates with one kind of energy - RF and self unit of measurement of speed transfer of RF - voltage. RF initially exists in each chunk and can be replenished or faded, depending on the player's actions and various events. RF is, most likely, a familiar kind of energy, so we'll move on to the second. Voltage is an indicative unit of energy, it can not be stored, it is immediately used (For easier understanding of the voltage, it can be considered as RF in tick). To make a field that will create any voltage in the mechanisms, it is necessary to craft a {"BlockHighVoltageGenerator"high_voltage_generator}. If the voltage is high, then the field can be dangerous. Also, when working with the field, the energy does not disappear, so the energy that does not come to you, moves to the {"chunks"chunk}. If you do not follow the charge in the chunk, then there may be different strange phenomena
