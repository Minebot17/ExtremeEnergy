Implants
Implantation
key0=The newest implants, made from energy crystals, allow you to be stronger and better. The ability depends on the installed module. Since this technology is connected to your brain, it can design a picture directly to you in the brain, ignoring the absence of the eyes. The chip projects the charge of its internal battery to the user, the connection to the field and what charge the environment has in real time. Also, the user can open the implant interface, where he can configure the modules and implant (By default, the C button). The exoskeleton interface is opened in a different way (By default, the Z button). If the implant has a fast and good processor, then it can efficiently process the data from the exoskeleton, converting the energy received from the impact. The energy conversion algorithm is specified by the module in the processor. The energy for transformations can be obtained only from the environment or from an internal generator. To implant yourself, you first need to craft this kind of syringe:
key1=Then it is necessary to fill any of the implants with the desired {"modules"modules}: press RMB with implant in the hands. You will open an interface with slots. One of the slots (which no color) is a slot for the armor processor, and the others for the modules. The blue color of the slot is for the first level modules, the yellow for the second, and the red for the third. After installing the modules, connect the syringe and the implant into the craft, and get a filled syringe. And press shift+RMB with him in the hands. Congratulations, you implanted yourself. To pull it out, you have to press shift + RMB with an empty syringe in the hands. When implanted or pulled out, the syringe breaks down
