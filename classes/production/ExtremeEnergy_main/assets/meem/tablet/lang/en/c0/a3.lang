Field
Working with the field
key0=The field can be created using RF in a {"BlockHighVoltageGenerator"high_voltage_generator}. The field shape generated by the generator is a cube, with a given radius and voltage. The larger the radius, the more voltage is lost. Many machines and implants receive field voltage. The higher voltage, the better the machines work and the faster the energy flows into the implant. Also, the field can be {"BlockFieldTransmitter"transmitted}, {"BlockFieldTransducer"transform_back_to_RF} and {"BlockFieldConverter"converted} into energy and matter of another type. The field is propagated only at its specified frequency. Respectively, so that the machine accepts a field with a frequency of N, it must be tuned to the frequency N. In the interface, the frequency can easily be copy, past, generate, or write
key1=(1)Input field for frequency (2)Copy Frequency (3)Past frequency from the buffer (4)Generate random
key2=Also, the machines have the limit of the received voltage, so when it is overcome, there will be an explosion. Initially, any machine can work on {"chunks"energy_around}, without a generator, but the voltage will be very small
