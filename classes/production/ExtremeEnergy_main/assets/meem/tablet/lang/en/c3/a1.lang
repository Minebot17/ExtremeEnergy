Crystals
Energy Crystals
key0=These crystals are endowed with special properties that allow you to convert and store energy. Their 3 kinds, the first kind allows to transform RF into other kinds of energy, the second one can transform RF into matter, transform energy and reconstruct the structure of matter, the third can apply forces to the substance and what the previous ones could. Using these properties, you can create amazing technologies. But it's not so simple, the better the crystal, the harder it is to get it and even more difficult to defend against its initial energy. When you break this ore, the crystals fall out charged. To discharge the crystal, it is necessary to have a capacitor in the inventory, then all the energy of the crystal will pass to it. Caution: in this way you can charge the capacitor completely, but the charge in the crystal will remain. So if the capacitor is fully charged or you do not have it at all, then you will be charged, this is painful enough. When the ore is destroyed, drop 1 or 2 pieces of crystals
key1=This is the first kind of crystals. It is generated often, up to 4 blocks together, at an altitude of 30 to 60. Destroyed by a stone pick and above. Each crystal has a charge of 5000 RF
key2=Crystals of yellow color. It is not generated as often as the first. Appear up to 3 blocks together, at an altitude of 15 to 40. Destroyed by an iron pick and above. Each crystal has a charge of 50000 RF
key3=The most powerful kind of crystals. It is generated rarely, up to 2 blocks together, at a height of 5 to 15. Destroyed by a diamond pickaxe. Each crystal has a charge of 500000 RF
